## About Me

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department, where I direct the Data System Research (DSR) Lab.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2013. Before joining the University of Memphis, I served as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. Additionally, I hold postdoctoral fellowships at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and HKUST in 2014 and 2015, respectively.
