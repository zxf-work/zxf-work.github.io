I got my Ph.D. in computer science and engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2013. Before joining the University of Memphis's [Department of Computer Science][cs], I was a postdoc research fellow at the University of Waterloo's [Cheriton School of Computer Science][dsg]. I also worked as a postdoc in the [Chinese University of Hong Kong][cuhk] and [HKUST][hkust] in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

## Research Interests

I am fasinated by developing new algorithms and toolkits for time efficient and scalable data management. From traditional RDBMS query acceleration to emerging semantic-rich, knowledge-extractable graph data management, my research insterest spans accross novel storage model, query optimization (both exact and approximate), and the theory of data-intensive parallel/distributed computing.

If you are interested in database research, especially topics in large scale graph management, e.g., novel storage format, query engine design & optimization, approximate analytics and among others, please contact me.
